Redis volume worked nicely with

volumes:
- ./redis:/data
entrypoint: redis-server --appendonly yes

However, postgres volumes had a problem. An error stated that "data directory /var/lib/postgresql/data has wrong ownership".

Found a workaround in 

https://forums.docker.com/t/data-directory-var-lib-postgresql-data-pgdata-has-wrong-ownership/17963

It was to add this to docker-compose.yml:

db:
  volumes:
  - data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

and 

volumes:
  data:
    external: true

and run 

docker volume create --name data -d local

I then got all previously created messages in the Webpack App when pressing Get All Messages button.
Other buttons also worked, except 2.5, which I didn't do at all.

Only problem is that I don't know where the data is located on my own computer.
