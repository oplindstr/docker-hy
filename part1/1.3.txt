First start a container from the ubuntu image with

docker run --name curler -it ubuntu:16.04

Then, inside, install curl with

apt-get update
apt-get install -y curl

Then exit and start it again with

docker start curler

Then run the script:

docker exec -it curler sh -c "read website; sleep 3; curl http://$website"

And finally give helsinki.fi as input

This worked from my Windows machine and the basic command line. I understood that the read command might need the -p flag for waiting for input, but it worked for me without it.
